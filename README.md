# Third Module Challenge
 
 My motivation for creating this project was to allow users to create a secure random password with ease. I learned how to build a random password generator.

## Usage

To use this application simply click the "Generate Password" button, follow the prompts to make your selections. Once all of the prompts are finished, your newly generated password will appear.
