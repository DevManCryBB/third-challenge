# Third Module Challenge
 
 My motivation for creating this project was to allow users to create a secure random password with ease. I learned how to build a random password generator.

## Usage

To use this application simply follow the prompts to make your selections and once all of the prompts are finished, click the "Generate Password" button.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:

![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
